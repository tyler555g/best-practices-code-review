# AI Agent Development Best Practices

## 12-Factor Agents

Apply the **[12-Factor Agents](https://github.com/humanlayer/12-factor-agents)** framework (Dex Horthy / HumanLayer) when building LLM-powered applications.

Key factors most relevant to AI memory and task systems:

| Factor | Principle | Application |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| F3 | Own Your Context Window | Search before create; structure notes for retrieval, not storage |
| F5 | Unify Execution State and Business State | The note IS the state — don't maintain status in two places |
| F6 | Launch / Pause / Resume | Explicit pause protocol before compaction; explicit resume protocol on start |
| F9 | Compact Errors Into Context | Reflect = distill signal, discard noise; remove resolved error traces |
| F12 | Make Your Agent a Stateless Reducer | Session start = read state; session end = write state; never rely on in-context memory across sessions |

## AI Attribution

Always attribute AI contributions in commits and PRs:

```
Co-authored-by: GitHub Copilot CLI v1.0.32 (claude-sonnet-4.6) <223556219+Copilot@users.noreply.github.com>
Copilot-Session: <session-id>
```

- Include model name and version
- Include session ID for traceability
- Attribute sub-agents separately if they performed distinct work
- Reference frameworks and methodologies used (with links to original sources)

## AI-Assisted Coding Workflow

### Human Review is Required

**Always review AI-generated output before considering it complete.**

- AI produces a first draft — you are the final decision-maker
- Review diffs, PRs, and generated files before approving or merging
- Do not rely on the AI's own "verification" as a substitute for your own eyes

### You Tag, Not the AI

**Never let AI tag repo owners, maintainers, or reviewers on a PR/issue.**

- AI should open PRs as **draft** or leave them requiring your explicit promotion
- You decide when work is ready for external review
- You @mention maintainers and add reviewers — not the AI
- This prevents unsolicited pings and represents you professionally

### Workflow Pattern
```
AI implements → you review → you decide it's ready → you tag maintainer
```

## Open Source AI Projects

- Contribute improvements back to upstream before publishing independently
